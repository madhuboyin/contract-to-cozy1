# Executive Summary — Home Timeline

## What It Is
**Home Timeline** is a narrative-driven feature that transforms a homeowner’s activity data into a cohesive, chronological story of their home. It unifies purchases, improvements, maintenance, claims, documents, and value changes into a single timeline that can be viewed as a **functional list** or an **immersive visual replay**.

This turns routine home management into a meaningful, emotionally engaging experience.

## Why It Matters

Homeownership is emotional, but most digital tools treat it as transactional.  
Home Timeline bridges this gap by helping users **see progress, investment, and care over time** — creating attachment, pride, and retention.
